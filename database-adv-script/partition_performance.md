# Partitioning Performance Report

## âœ… Objective

Optimize slow queries on a large `Booking` table using partitioning.

## ðŸ§± Implementation

* Partitioned by `YEAR(start_date)`.
* Query used:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Booking
WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-06-30';
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Observations

* Non-partitioned: Full table scan, slower.
* Partitioned: Scanned only relevant partitions, faster.

## âœ… Conclusion

Partitioning improved performance by reducing scanned data. Recommended for large time-based datasets with date-range filters.
